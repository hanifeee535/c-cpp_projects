# Random Number Guessing Game

## Description
This project is a **Random Number Guessing Game** implemented in C++ using the **<random> library** to generate a random number within a specified range. The program challenges the user to guess the random number, providing feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed. It also tracks the total number of attempts the user makes.

### Key Features:
1. **Random Number Generation**:
   - Utilizes modern C++ random number generation techniques with `random_device`, `default_random_engine`, and `uniform_int_distribution` for high-quality randomness.
2. **User Interaction**:
   - Guides the user with interactive prompts and feedback to refine their guesses.
3. **Statistics**:
   - Displays the total number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.

### Technologies Used:
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Random Number Generation**: Modern C++ `<random>` library
- **Development Environment**: Any standard C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
